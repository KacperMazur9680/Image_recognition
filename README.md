## Image recognition

My intensions with this repo is to learn about specific subjects of machine learning, to be more accurate:
* Computer Vision
* Image classification
* Object detection

At the end I of my studies, I want to create a project called *Table extractor*, which will take data from a `.jpeg` and insert them into an excel file, therefore automating the process of writing data to excel by hand.
